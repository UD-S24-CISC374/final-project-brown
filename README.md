Oh no! You and your duck family have been seperated! You need to find your way back to each family member and bring them all together. Using Dijkstra's Algorithm you will find the shortest path of stepping stones across a pond to get to a family member on the other side. Complete each level to gain another member of your family back. Pass all five levels to reunite with your mother and become one big happy duck family again.
